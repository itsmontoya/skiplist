# Skiplist
`skiplist` is a high-performance Go library implementing the skip list data structure with a unique deterministic level assignment. Instead of relying on randomization, this library assigns levels based on insertion count, offering a predictable and structured approach. Each level is represented using a memory-mapped file, ensuring efficient storage and quick access, even for large datasets. Skip lists provide an excellent alternative to balanced trees, delivering fast search, insertion, and deletion operations with average-case O(log n) performance. With `skiplist`, you can harness the power of skip lists with enhanced predictability and memory efficiency, perfect for applications requiring scalable and performant data management.
